Text	At the same time , some of the younger American figure skaters progressed more quickly due to the lack of senior skaters competing in the field .	Scott Allen won a silver medal at the 1962 U.S. Championships when he was just twelve years old , and then won bronze at the 1964 Winter Olympics the week of his fifteenth birthday , becoming one of the youngest Olympic medalists in history .	It was not until 1965 that the U.S. started to win medals at the World Championships again ; and the U.S. did not regain international prominence in figure skating until the 1968 Winter Olympics when Peggy Fleming won gold in the ladies ' event and Tim Wood won silver in the men 's .	As the fatalities included many top American coaches as well as the skating team , the tragedy was also indirectly responsible for bringing foreign coaches to the U.S. to fill the vacuum that was left behind .	U.S. Figure Skating team coach , William Kipp , who was one of those who died on the Brussels flight , was eventually replaced by British former world champion pairs skater John Nicks in the fall of 1961 .
