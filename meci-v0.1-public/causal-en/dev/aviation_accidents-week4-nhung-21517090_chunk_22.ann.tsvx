Text	One conclusion determined that both the captain and the first officer were fatigued at the time of the accident , but the NTSB could not determine how much it degraded their performance .	Among those conclusions were the fact that both the captain and the first officer responded to the stall warning in a manner contrary to their training .	The NTSB could not explain why the first officer retracted the flaps and suggested that the landing gear should also be retracted , though it did find that the current approach - stall training was not adequate :	NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman , while concurring , made it clear that she considered fatigue to be a contributing factor .	She compared the 20 years that fatigue had remained on the NTSB 's Most Wanted List of transportation safety improvements , during which no meaningful action was taken by regulators in response , to the changes in tolerance for alcohol over the same period , noting that the impact on performance from fatigue and alcohol were similar .
