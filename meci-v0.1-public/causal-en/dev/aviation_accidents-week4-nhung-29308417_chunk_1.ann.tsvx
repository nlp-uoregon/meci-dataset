Text	A subsequent investigation found a simulated engine failure procedure was being conducted , which involved a member of the crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off .	Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far , it would cause the propeller to reverse â€” a feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing .	Once the landing gear was raised , the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position , since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised .	The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine , thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank .	Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised , that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine , causing the DC - 6 to spiral out of control .
