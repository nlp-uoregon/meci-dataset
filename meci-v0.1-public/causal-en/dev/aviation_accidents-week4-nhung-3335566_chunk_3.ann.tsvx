Text	He had been friends with strategic theorist ( and later Nobel prize winner in economics ) Thomas Schelling since they worked in the administration of the Marshall Plan in Paris .	In 1964 , when McNaughton and Schelling were teaching at Harvard , Schelling was asked to work at the Department of Defense .	He suggested McNaughton go instead , promising to advise McNaughton on weapons and strategy ; McNaughton was appointed Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs .	Together , they outlined a bombing strategy to intimidate North Vietnam in the spring of 1964 , leading to the first phase of Operation Rolling Thunder which took place between March 2 and 24 , 1965 .	The conditions for a bombing halt , outlined in a confidential memorandum by McNaughton to McNamara were that North Vietnam must not only cease infiltration efforts , but also take steps to withdraw troops currently operating in South Vietnam .
