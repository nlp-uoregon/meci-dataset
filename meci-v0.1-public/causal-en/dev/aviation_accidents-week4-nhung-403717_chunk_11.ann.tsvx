Text	Although there was no damage to the secondary O- ring , this indicated that the primary O- ring was not creating a reliable seal and was allowing hot gas to pass .	The amount of O- ring erosion was insufficient to prevent the O- ring from sealing , and investigators concluded that the soot between the O-rings resulted from non-uniform pressure at the time of ignition .	The January 1985 launch of was the coldest Space Shuttle launch to date .	The air temperature was at the time of launch , and the calculated O- ring temperature was .	Post-flight analysis revealed erosion in primary O-rings in both SRBs .
