Text	According to the Dublin Evening Herald , cargo and some mail were destroyed in the resulting fire but it is unclear where the mail had been loaded .	The No. 4 engine suffered a fatigue failure of its No. 1 propeller blade .	According to lab results , the blade had previously been bent which resulted " in the disruption of the compressive stresses in the shot peened area of the propeller blade " being the probable cause because the unbalanced loads on the engine mounts resulted in the separation of the entire engine .
