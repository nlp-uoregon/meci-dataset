Text	The NTSB further found that an incorrect maintenance procedure , which was implemented by Emery Worldwide Airlines , introduced an incorrect torque - loading on the bolts that were supposed to connect the control rod .	The NTSB released its final report in 2003 , three years after the accident .	The report stated that the crash of Flight 17 was caused by the detachment of the right elevator control tab .	The disconnection was caused by the failure to properly secure and inspect the attachment bolt .	The NTSB then added : " The safety issues discussed in this report include DC - 8 elevator position indicator installation and usage , adequacy of DC - 8 maintenance work cards ( required inspection items ) , and DC - 8 elevator control tab design .
