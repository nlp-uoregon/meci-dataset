Text	Lehmann often came into conflict with Hugo Eckener over the safety of his piloting techniques .	Lehmann cancelled important flight tests for the _ Hindenburg _ to fulfill a request by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda for the _ Hindenburg _ and the _ Graf Zeppelin _ to take part in a propaganda flight (_ Deutschlandfahrt _ ) in support of Adolf Hitler .	Lehmann insisted on making the flight despite unfavorable weather conditions , which resulted in high winds damaging the _ Hindenburg_ { {â€™}} s lower fin as the airship was being removed from its hangar .	Eckener criticised Lehmann harshly and publicly for endangering the new airship and the entire zeppelin program to impress the Nazis .	However , Lehmann never actually joined the Nazi Party despite his apparent support .
