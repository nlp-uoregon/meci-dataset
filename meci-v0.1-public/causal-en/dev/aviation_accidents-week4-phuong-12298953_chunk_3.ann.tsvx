Text	While the Congonhas runway was under renovation , the 2006 – 07 Brazilian aviation crisis continued to advance , meaning that the runway was open for use despite the incomplete refit .	On July 16 , the day before the crash , four pilots who landed at the airport reported poor braking , including a TAM pilot , who managed to stop his aircraft just a few metres before the end of the runway .	Between 12:25 pm and 12:28 pm , Infraero suspended operations at the airport to examine the runway conditions , and cleared it after reporting " no puddles and water slides . "	At 12:42 local time the same day , Pantanal Linhas Aéreas Flight 4763 , an ATR 42- 300 , hydroplaned after touching down on runway 17 R .	The aircraft veered to the left , struck a concrete box and a small light pole , and entered the grass between the runway and taxiway .
