Text	Alexander seems to have been dubious about the plans for Yugoslavia , as throughout the war , he spoke in terms of liberating Serbia .	The introduction of the 14 Points by the American President Woodrow Wilson in January 1918 increased Alexander 's doubts about Yugoslavia as Point 10 spoke of " substantial autonomy " in the Austrian Empire after the war , not breaking it up .	Not willing to antagonise Wilson , Alexander favored a " greater Serbia " that saw the Serbs annex certain provinces of the Austrian Empire .	Though the Crown Prince declared in a speech during a visit to Britain that he was " fighting for Yugoslav unity in a Yugoslav state " , when he addressed his own soldiers he stated he was fighting for " the reestablishment of Serbia , our dear homeland " .	In a sign of the trouble to come , TrumbiÄ‡ demanded to have the right to speak for the South Slavs living under Austrian rule , a demand that Alexander rejected under the grounds that the Serb government represented the South Slavs .
