Text	THE BATTLE OF GLENMALURE ( ) took place in Ireland on 25 August 1580 during the Desmond Rebellions .	An Irish Catholic force made up of the Gaelic clans from the Wicklow Mountains led by Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne and James Eustace , 3rd Viscount Baltinglass of the Pale , defeated an English army under Arthur Grey , 14th Baron Grey de Wilton , at the O'Byrnes ' mountain stronghold of Glenmalure .	Grey had landed in Ireland with reinforcements from England to put down the rebellion .	His strategy was to meet O'Byrne 's threat to the English heartland of Dublin and the Pale by attacking through the highlands to the south of the city .	Against the advice of veteran commanders , he chose to lead his army ( around 3,000 strong ) through lowland Kildare and into the Wicklow Mountains , with the aim of taking the fastness at Balinacor in the Glenmalure Valley .
