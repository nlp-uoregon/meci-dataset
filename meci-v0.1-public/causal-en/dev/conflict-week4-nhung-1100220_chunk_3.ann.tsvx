Text	[ WB1401 warning receiver ]	It was the responsibility of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation ( UKWMO ) at the United Kingdom Regional Air Operations Centre ( UK RAOC ) located at RAF Booker to alert the nation to an imminent air attack .	Once an alert was initiated the national and local television and radio networks would break into transmissions and broadcast a warning ( the warning message would originate from an emergency studio in BBC Broadcasting House in London ) .	Simultaneously the national air raid siren system would be brought into service .	A system , which used the same frequency on normal telephone lines as the peacetime speaking clock , was employed for this whereby a key switch activation alerted 250 national Carrier Control Points or CCPs present in police stations across the country .
