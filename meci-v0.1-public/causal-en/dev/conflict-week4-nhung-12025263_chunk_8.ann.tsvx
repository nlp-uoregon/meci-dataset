Text	Emperor Taizong 's chancellor Wei Zheng advised allowing Gaochang to remain as a vassal , with Qu Zhisheng continuing to serve as king , but Emperor Taizong decided against doing so , instead annexing Gaochang territory and creating two prefectures — Xi Prefecture ( 西 州 , headquartered at Gaochang ) and Ting Prefecture ( 庭州 , headquartered at Kehanfutu ) .	He furthered established the Protectorate General to Pacify the West at the fortress of Jiaohe ( 交河 , near Gaochang as well ) to keep a military presence .	Hou took Qu Zhisheng and his officials back to Chang 'an , while returning several cities that Gaochang had previously seized from Yanqi back to Yanqi .	Emperor Taizong created Qu Zhisheng the Duke of Jincheng and kept him as a general at Chang 'an .	Emperor Taizong tried to strengthen Xi Prefecture 's defense by commuting the condemned prisoners ' death penalties and instead exiling them to Xi Prefecture , while conscripting people originally sentenced to exile into the army defending Xi Prefecture , with a term of service commensurate with the length of exile they were originally sentenced .
