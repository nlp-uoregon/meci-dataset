Text	Organizations such as the Knights of Labor had little power in confronting owners .	Miners demanding better working conditions or wage increases were often fired .	When local unions sought such changes , they were easily driven out of the mining districts .	During the 1896 - 97 strike of the Cloud City Miners ' Union in Leadville , Colorado , mine owners formed a secret verbal agreement among themselves that none of them would recognize the union or negotiate with it , an arrangement later revealed in a report by the Colorado State Legislature .	Mine owners went a step further and formed a Mine Owners ' Association in response to union organizing in the mining district of Coeur d' Alene , Idaho during the 1880s .
