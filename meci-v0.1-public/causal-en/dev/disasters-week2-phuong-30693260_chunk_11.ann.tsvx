Text	" In February 1971 , the FAA was advised by the County that the dump would be closed by August 1972 , " as stated in the NTSB accident report .	However , the landfill site was not closed in 1972 , and remained open at the time of the accident .	Investigators concluded it was likely the dump was a factor in the accident : " There is little doubt that the municipal dump located adjacent to the airport property attracts birds which are a serious hazard to aircraft . "	Furthermore , the NTSB concluded the FAA had not intervened to take action with regards to the dump .	" In following up on the compliance requirements for airports developed or improved with Federal funds , the FAA did not take adequate measures , in accordance with existing statues , to assure that the hazard was removed from the vicinity of the airport .
