Text	The co-pilot reported to Captain Chun twice during the flight after the missiles ' detonation , " Engines normal , sir . "	The first missile was radar - controlled and proximity fuzed , and detonated behind the aircraft .	Sending fragments forward , it either severed or unraveled the crossover cable from the left inboard elevator to the right elevator .	This , with damage to one of the four hydraulic systems , caused KAL 007 to ascend from , at which point the autopilot was disengaged .	Fragments from the proximity fuzed air - to - air missile that detonated behind the aircraft , punctured the fuselage and caused rapid decompression of the pressurised cabin .
