Text	Millions of children worldwide do not receive all of the routine vaccinations as per their national schedule .	As immunization is a powerful public health strategy for improving child survival , it is important to determine what strategies work best to increase coverage .	A Cochrane review assessed the effectiveness of intervention strategies to boost and sustain high childhood immunization coverage in low - and middle - income countries .	Fourteen trials were included but most of the evidence was of low quality .	Providing parents and other community members with information on immunization , health education at facilities in combination with redesigned immunization reminder cards , regular immunization outreach with and without household incentives , home visits , and integration of immunization with other services may improve childhood immunization coverage in low - and middle - income countries .
