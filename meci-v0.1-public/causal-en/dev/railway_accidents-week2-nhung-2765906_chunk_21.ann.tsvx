Text	_ " The master of a vessel approaching the Bridge to navigate it through a span must ( a ) have the vessel fully under control ; and ( b ) navigate the vessel with all possible care at the minimum speed required to pass safely under the bridge " ._	Vessels above a certain size are required to be piloted , and vehicle movements on the bridge are temporarily halted when large vessels are to pass underneath the bridge .	As an added precaution , it is now mandatory for most large vessels to have a tug in attendance as they transit the bridge in the event that assistance with steerage may be required .	thumb | center | upright =2 | 2005 panorama of Hobart illustrating the extent of the city 's reliance on the Tasman Bridge	The disaster stimulated development in Kingborough , a municipality south of Hobart on the western shore , because of the reduced travel times for western shore workers compared to the eastern shore .
