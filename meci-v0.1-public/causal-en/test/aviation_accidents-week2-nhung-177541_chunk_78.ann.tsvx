Text	NASA planned to return the space shuttle to service around September 2004 ; that date was pushed back to July 2005 .	On July 26 , 2005 , at 10:39 EST , Space Shuttle _ Discovery _ cleared the tower on the " Return to Flight " mission STS - 114 , marking the shuttle 's return to space .	Overall the STS - 114 flight was highly successful , but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed , although the debris did not strike the Orbiter .	Due to this , NASA once again grounded the shuttles until the remaining problem was understood and a solution implemented .	After delaying their reentry by two days due to adverse weather conditions , Commander Eileen Collins and Pilot James M. Kelly returned _ Discovery _ safely to Earth on August 9 , 2005 .
