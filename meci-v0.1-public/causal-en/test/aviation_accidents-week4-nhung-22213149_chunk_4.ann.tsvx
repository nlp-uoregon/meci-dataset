Text	The first officer , whose own ADI would have shown the true angle of bank , failed to participate in full crew resource management techniques , saying nothing to challenge his captain 's actions nor made any attempt to take over the flight with his own controls .	The older and more experienced flight engineer did call out " bank " four times in 19 seconds , but the captain ignored his warnings , continued to ignore the chiming alarm , made no verbal response , and actually continued to increase the left bank angle .	At 18:38 , 55 seconds after take - off , Flight 8509 's left wing dragged along the ground , then the aircraft plunged into the ground at a speed of between 250 and 300 knots , in a 40 ° pitch down and 90 ° left bank attitude .	The aircraft exploded on impact .	After the investigation , the United Kingdom 's Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) issued recommendations to Korean Air to revise its training program and company culture , to promote a more free atmosphere between the captain and the first officer .
