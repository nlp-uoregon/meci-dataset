Text	Those tests established that the damage to the wing 's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from to .	The DC - 10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall : the slat disagreement warning light , which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats , and the stick shaker on the captain 's control column , which activates close to the stall speed .	Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number - one engine .	Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine .	The first officer 's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker ; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer , but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC - 10 fleet .
