Text	Since the plane was so close to the ground , the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact .	In the aftermath of the accident , the Civil Aeronautics Administration ( CAA ) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC - 6 and DC - 6 B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades .	United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC - 6 aircraft , which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed .	On April 4 , 1955 , a United Airlines check captain , Stanley C. Hoyt , age 45 , was carrying out instrument rating checks on two of the airline 's pilots .	Hoyt had been employed by United Airlines since 1937 , and had 9,763 flying hours experience , 549 of which were in a DC - 6 .
