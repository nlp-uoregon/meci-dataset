Text	The record - low temperatures of the launch reduced the elasticity of the rubber O - rings , reducing their ability to seal the joints .	The broken seals caused a breach into the joint shortly after lift off , which allowed pressurized gas from within the SRB to leak and burn through the wall to the adjacent external fuel tank .	This led to the separation of the right - hand SRB 's aft attachment , which caused it to crash into the external tank , which caused a structural failure of the external tank and an explosion .	Following the explosion , the orbiter , which included the crew compartment , was broken up by aerodynamic forces .	The crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were recovered from the ocean floor after a three - month search - and - recovery operation .
