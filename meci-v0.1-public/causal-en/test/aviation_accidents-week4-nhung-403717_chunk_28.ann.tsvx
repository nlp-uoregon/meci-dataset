Text	It then traveled in a ballistic arc , reaching the highest point ( apogee ) of approximately 25 seconds after the explosion .	At the time of separation , the maximum acceleration is estimated to have been between 12 and 20 times that of gravity ( g ) ; within two seconds it had dropped below 4 g , and within ten seconds the cabin was in free fall .	The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury to the crew .	At least some of the crew were alive and at least briefly conscious after the breakup , as the Personal Egress Air Packs ( PEAPs ) were activated for Smith and two unidentified crewmembers , but not for Scobee .	The PEAPs were not intended for in - flight use , and the astronauts never trained with them for an in - flight emergency .
