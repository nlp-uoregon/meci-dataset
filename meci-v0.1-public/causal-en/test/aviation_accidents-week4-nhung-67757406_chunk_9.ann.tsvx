Text	Some small soot marks and damage was seen on the surface of the radome , and although there was heat damage inside , there were no holes .	The APU exhaust was damaged with sections of molten metal , but no further damage to the aircraft was revealed .	Tests and inspections of the elevator and autopilot control systems did not reveal any abnormalities .	Examination of meteorological information revealed that the aircraft had been struck by triggered lightning , a phenomenon in which an aircraft accumulating a negative charge during flight triggers a strike when approaching a positively charged region in a thunderstorm cell .	The Met Office ’s lightning detection system observed a lightning strike at the aircraft ’s recorded position at 19:10:20 .
