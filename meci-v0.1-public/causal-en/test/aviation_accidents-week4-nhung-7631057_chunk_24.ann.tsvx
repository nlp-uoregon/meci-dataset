Text	The USSR , the state of manufacture of the aircraft , was given a draft of the final report and a chance to review and submit comments in accordance with ICAO convention .	In their remarks , the USSR reiterated their endorsement of the previously agreed upon factual information contained in the draft .	However regarding the analysis , conclusions and recommendations that followed , the Soviets stated the basic task of the investigation should be to determine the reasons for the 37Â° turn , which " remained unsolved in the report " , and that conclusions of the draft based on the crew 's errors were " totally ungrounded " .	They ended their remarks with a full rejection of the draft , calling it " worthless " , and instead offering their own analysis and conclusions .	The Soviet delegation stated the theory that the crew had mistakenly selected the Matsapa VOR was contradicted by the known settings of the onboard navigation equipment and the timing of the turn .
