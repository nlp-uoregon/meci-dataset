Text	The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigated the incident , assisted by the Marine Corps , Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , Hughes Airwest , and the Airline Pilots Association .	Early statements released by the NTSB revealed that the F - 4 B fighter had attempted to swerve away from the DC - 9 immediately prior to impact , and that an additional 10 feet of clearance would have averted the entire collision .	Additionally , the NTSB confirmed that the fighter had impacted the DC - 9 in two places , with its right wing impacting the airliner 's forward passenger cabin and the vertical stabilizer " slicing through " the cockpit .	The DC - 9 carried a primitive flight data recorder that recorded basic information about the aircraft 's air speed , acceleration , heading , and altitude on metal foil tapes .	Additionally , the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations that took place in the cockpit of the aircraft .
