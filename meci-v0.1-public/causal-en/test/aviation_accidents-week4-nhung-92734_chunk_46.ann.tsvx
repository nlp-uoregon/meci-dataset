Text	Facts showed that there had been misinterpretations and false assumptions before the accident .	Analysis of the CVR transcript showed that the KLM pilot thought that he had been cleared for take off , while the Tenerife control tower believed that the KLM 747 was stationary at the end of the runway , awaiting take off clearance .	It appears that KLM 's co-pilot was not as certain about take - off clearance as the captain .	The investigation concluded that the fundamental cause of the accident was that captain Veldhuyzen van Zanten attempted to take off without clearance .	The investigators suggested the reason for this was a desire to leave as soon as possible in order to comply with KLM 's duty - time regulations ( which went in place earlier that year ) and before the weather deteriorated further .
