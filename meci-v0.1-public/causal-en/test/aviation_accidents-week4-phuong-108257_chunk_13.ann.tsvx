Text	If , however , the plane was more than from the flight - planned course line when the pilot turned the autopilot mode selector from HEADING to INS , the plane would continue to track the heading selected in HEADING mode as long as the actual position of the plane was more than from the programmed INS course line .	The autopilot computer software commanded the INS mode to remain in the " armed " condition until the plane had moved to a position less than from the desired course line .	Once that happened , the INS mode would change from " armed " to " capture " and the plane would track the flight - planned course from then on .	The HEADING mode of the autopilot would normally be engaged sometime after take off to comply with vectors from ATC , and then after receiving appropriate ATC clearance , to guide the plane to intercept the desired INS course line .	The Anchorage VOR beacon was not operational because of maintenance .
