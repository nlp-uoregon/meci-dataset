Text	Most commonly : One attacker , two or multiple attackers rush toward tori and try to grab both elbows .	Tori 's challenge is to apply strategy , quick taisabaki , and to maintain aikido 's approach which is - avoiding as much as possible from hurting the attackers .	Therefore , tori does not punch , but rather tries to avoid the attacks or to throw the attackers .	In some aikido styles , the attack is free , and so are the techniques applied - as long as they follow the principles of aikido .	Although in karate the word _ kumite _ is usually reserved for sparring , some schools also employ the term _ randori _ with regard to " mock - combat " in which both karateka move with speed , parrying and attacking with all four limbs ( including knees , elbows , etc. ) .
