Text	The British and Canadians were able to link up and resume the drive on Caen the following day , but three days into the invasion , the advance was halted .	On 7 June , Operation Perch , a pincer attack by the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division and XXX Corps was launched to encircle Caen from the east and west flanks .	The 21st Panzer Division halted the 51st Division advance and the XXX Corps attack resulted in the Battle of Villers - Bocage and the withdrawal of the leading elements of the 7th Armoured Division soon after .	The next offensive , codenamed Operation Epsom , was launched by VIII Corps on 26 June , to envelope Caen from the west .	German forces managed to contain the offensive but to do so , they were obliged to commit all their available strength .
