Text	As soon as the Congress was over , the party launched a wave of weapon snatches , attacks on police , prison escapes and annihilation campaigns .	By 1973 - 74 10 policemen in West Bengal were killed by the party and there were 39 incidents of gun snatching .	But when the state machinery came down on the revolutionaries heavily , the party had to face a serious setback .	Most of the leaders were either incarcerated or killed .	The reorganisation process , therefore , began after August 1977 when the detainees were released .
