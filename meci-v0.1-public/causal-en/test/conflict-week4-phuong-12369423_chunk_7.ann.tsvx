Text	On the Polish side the fighting was done mostly by a force privately financed by John Sobieski .	He gained reputation as an able , courageous commander and a patriot , having invested part of his personal fortune in the defense of the Commonwealth .	In 1674 he was elected King of Poland and ruled now as John III .	Sobieski 's reputation also preceded him in the Ottoman Empire , and his victory several years later at the battle of Vienna would ensure his reputation as the top commander fighting the Ottomans — however even he would not be able to stop the Commonwealth from decline and introduce reforms that would save the country .	The Commonwealth did regain the territories lost in this war after the Polish – Ottoman War ( 1683 – 1699 ) in 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz , but that was one of the last of its victories .
