Text	Credit default swaps ( CDS ) are financial instruments used as a hedge and protection for debtholders , in particular MBS investors , from the risk of default , or by speculators to profit from default .	As the net worth of banks and other financial institutions deteriorated because of losses related to subprime mortgages , the likelihood increased that those providing the protection would have to pay their counterparties .	This created uncertainty across the system , as investors wondered which companies would be required to pay to cover mortgage defaults .	Like all swaps and other financial derivatives , CDS may either be used to hedge risks ( specifically , to insure creditors against default ) or to profit from speculation .	The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100 - fold from 1998 to 2008 , with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts , as of November 2008 , ranging from US $ 33 to $ 47 trillion .
