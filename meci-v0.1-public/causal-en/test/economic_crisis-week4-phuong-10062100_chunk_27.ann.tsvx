Text	Subprime lending was a major contributor to this increase in home ownership rates and in the overall demand for housing , which drove prices higher .	Borrowers who would not be able to make the higher payments once the initial grace period ended , were planning to refinance their mortgages after a year or two of appreciation .	As a result of the depreciating housing prices , borrowers â€™ ability to refinance became more difficult .	Borrowers who found themselves unable to escape higher monthly payments by refinancing began to default .	As more borrowers stopped making their mortgage payments , foreclosures and the supply of homes for sale increased .
