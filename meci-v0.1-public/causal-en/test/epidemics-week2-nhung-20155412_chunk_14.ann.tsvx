Text	Cohn argues that the medieval and modern plagues were two distinct diseases differing in their symptoms , signs , and epidemiologies .	Cohn 's argument that medieval plague was not rat - based is supported by his claims that the modern and medieval plagues occurred in different seasons ( a claim supported in a 2009 article by Mark Welford and Brian Bossak ) , had unparalleled cycles of recurrence , and varied in the manner in which immunity was acquired .	The modern plague reaches its peak in seasons with high humidity and a temperature of between and , as rats ' fleas thrive in this climate .	In comparison , the Black Death is recorded as occurring in periods during which rats ' fleas could not have survived , i.e. hot Mediterranean summers above .	In terms of recurrence , the Black Death on average did not resurface in an area for between five and fifteen years after it had occurred .
