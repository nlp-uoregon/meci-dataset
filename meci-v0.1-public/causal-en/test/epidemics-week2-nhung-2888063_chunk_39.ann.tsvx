Text	In PHASE 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans , and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat .	In PHASE 3 , an animal or human - animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people , but has not resulted in human - to - human transmission sufficient to sustain community - level outbreaks .	Limited human - to - human transmission may occur under some circumstances , for example , when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver .	However , limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic .	PHASE 4 is characterized by verified human - to - human transmission of an animal or human - animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause " community - level outbreaks " .
