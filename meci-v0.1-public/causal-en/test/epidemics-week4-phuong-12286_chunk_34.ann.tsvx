Text	It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year .	In the few districts where intact records remain , plague deaths varied between 30 % and over 50 % of the total population .	it was very dismal to behold the red crosses , and read in great letters “ LORD , HAVE MERCY UPON US ” on the doors , and watchmen standing before them with halberds ... people passing by them so gingerly , and with such fearful looks as if they had been lined with enemies in ambush to destroy them .	.. a man at the corner of Artillery - wall , that as I judge , through the dizziness of his head with the disease , which seized upon him there , had dasht his face against the wall ; and when I came by , he lay hanging with his bloody face over the rails , and bleeding upon the ground ...	I went and spoke to him ; he could make no answer , but rattled in the throat , and as I was informed , within half an hour died in the place .
