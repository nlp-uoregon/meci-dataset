Text	[ Great Plague of London in 1665 ]	The plague in London largely affected the poor , as the rich were able to leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin in other parts of the country .	The subsequent Great Fire of London ruined many city merchants and property owners .	As a result of these events , London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666 .	The street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged , but some improvements were made : streets were widened , pavements were created , open sewers abolished , wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden , and the design and construction of buildings controlled .
