Text	A RUNAWAY TRAIN is a type of railroad incident in which unattended rolling stock is accidentally allowed to roll onto the main line , a moving train loses enough braking power to be unable to stop in safety , or a train operates at unsafe speeds due to loss of operator control .	If the uncontrolled rolling stock derails or hits another train , it will result in a train wreck .	A railway air brake can fail if valves on the pipe between each wagon are accidentally closed ; the 1953 Pennsylvania Railroad train wreck and the 1988 Gare de Lyon train accident were results of a valve accidentally closed by the crew , reducing braking power .	A parked train or cut of cars may also run away if not properly tied down with a sufficient number of hand brakes .	Date Location Cause Details References
