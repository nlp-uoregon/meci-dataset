Text	The CHELFORD RAIL ACCIDENT occurred on 22 December 1894 at Chelford railway station .	The stationmaster was supervising shunting operations , during which a high - sided wagon was fly - shunted ( i.e. run - off ) into a siding in strong winds and rapidly fading light .	As another six wagons were being run onto an adjoining road , the stationmaster saw the high - sided wagon being blown out of its siding by the wind to meet them .	A collision occurred derailing the runaway in such a way that it fouled the main line just as the 16:15 Manchester to Crewe express approached , drawn by two locomotives , LNWR Waterloo Class 2-4-0 No 418 _Zygia_ and Experiment Class No 518 _Express_ .	The stationmaster ran towards them waving a red lamp but the drivers thought he was signalling to the shunters and did not slacken speed .
