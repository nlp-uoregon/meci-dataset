Text	On 9 August , Beauchamp - Proctor was leading No. 84 Squadron on a patrol over their base at Bertangles , with Boudwin and six - foot - four tall , fellow South African Hugh Saunders as wingmen .	The threesome got involved in a heated engagement at 2:00 pm , that involved them in combat against Fokker D.
