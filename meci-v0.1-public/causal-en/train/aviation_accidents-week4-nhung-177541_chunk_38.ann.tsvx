Text	Depressurization began when the shuttle forebody separated from the midbody 41 seconds after loss of control .	The crew module pressure vessel was penetrated when it collided with the fuselage , and the " depressurization rate was high enough to incapacitate the crew members within seconds so that they were unable to perform actions such as lowering their visors . "	The crew lost consciousness , suffering massive pulmonary barotrauma , ebullism and cessation of respiration .	The shuttle 's separated nose section rotated unsteadily about all three axes .	The crew ( now unconscious or dead ) were unable to brace against this motion , and were also harmed by aspects of their protective equipment :
