Text	Columbia Elementary school opened in August 2004 , and is located in Perris , California .	Following the loss of _ Columbia _ , the space shuttle program was suspended .	The further construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) was also delayed , as the space shuttles were the only available delivery vehicle for station modules .	The station was supplied using Russian uncrewed _ Progress _ ships , and crews were exchanged using Russian - crewed _ Soyuz _ spacecraft , and forced to operate on a skeleton crew of two .	Less than a year after the accident , President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration , calling for the space shuttle fleet to complete the ISS , with retirement by 2010 following the completion of the ISS , to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars .
