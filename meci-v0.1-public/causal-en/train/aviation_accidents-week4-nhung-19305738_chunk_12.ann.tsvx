Text	One notable discrepancy was that although the planned cruising altitude was 2,000 feet , every position report transmitted by _ Star Tiger _ gave the height as 20,000 feet .	Since 20,000 feet was a more typical cruising altitude for this route , it is possible the crew forgot they were flying at only 2,000 feet and simply flew the aircraft into the sea during the descent phase .	The crew may have been fatigued after the long flight , and contemporary altimeters were prone to misreading of the thousand - foot level .	The aircraft was however also fitted with a radio altimeter .	Twice before on similar flights the _ Star Tiger _ had been forced to divert to Gander , Newfoundland and just two months previously another Tudor IV had found itself landing with less than of fuel left ; less than the amount by which the _ Star Tiger _ was overloaded .
