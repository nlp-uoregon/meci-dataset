Text	The water was able to penetrate inside the sensor bodies , then froze in flight , rendering two of three of the sensors inoperative , thus removing the protection they normally provided in the aircraft 's flight management system .	The primary cause of the accident was that the crew attempted an improvised test of the AOA warning system , not knowing that it was not functioning properly due to the inoperative sensors .	They also disregarded the proper speed limits for the tests they were performing , resulting in a stall .	The aircraft 's computers received conflicting information from the three AOA sensors .	The aircraft computer system â€™s programming logic had been designed to reject one sensor value if it deviated significantly from the other two sensor values .
