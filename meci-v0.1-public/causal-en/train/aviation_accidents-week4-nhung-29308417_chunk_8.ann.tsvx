Text	The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust .	Should the pilot need to perform a go - around , he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust , enabling the pilot to execute a go - around maneuver .	The Douglas Aircraft Company designed a system that would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in - flight .	During development of the DC - 6 , the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air .	When there was enough weight on the landing gear ( which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground ) , a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closed â€” meaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed .
