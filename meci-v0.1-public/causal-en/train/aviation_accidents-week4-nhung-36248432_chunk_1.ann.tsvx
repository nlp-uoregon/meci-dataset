Text	He left the service in 1952 to join the Republic Aviation Corporation .	Ardery became an experimental and production test pilot for Republic Aviation , eventually being assigned to the F - 105 Thunderchief project as one of the principal test pilots for the fighter - bomber from its maiden flight in 1955 .	As the design was improved , he flew the newer variants , including the advanced D - model , specializing in checkout flights " on the sophisticated electronic units which make the jet literally ' automatic ' . "	In early 1960 , he successfully completed a 300 - mile roundtrip flight with " hands - off " or all on instruments except for take - off and landing .	" It was the longest instrument - controlled flight of the F - 105 D to date . "
