Text	The speed caused the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic condition known as vortex ring state .	In this condition , a vortex envelops the rotor , causing an aircraft to lose lift , in essence descending in its own downwash .	After two months of investigation by the Marine Corps Judge Advocate General a final report was released which absolved the aircraft itself of any mechanical faults and instead pinned the blame on the exceptionally high rate of descent coupled with human error .	After 16 years of the widows fighting the Marine Corps and the V - 22 Osprey program stakeholders , both pilots were vindicated when they were cleared of blame for the crash in 2016 by then Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work .	The crash resulted in a two - month moratorium on V - 22 test flights and further postponed its entry into operational military service .
