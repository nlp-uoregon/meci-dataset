Text	The landing gear could have been manually lowered , nonetheless .	The pilots cycled the landing gear , but still failed to get the confirmation light .	Loft , who was working the radio during this leg of the flight , told the tower that they would discontinue their approach to their airport and requested to enter a holding pattern .	The approach controller cleared the flight to climb to , and then hold west over the Everglades .	The cockpit crew removed the light assembly , and Second Officer Repo was dispatched to the avionics bay beneath the flight deck to confirm via a small porthole if the landing gear was indeed down .
