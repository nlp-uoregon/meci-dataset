Text	While still negotiating with the terrorists , who now numbered seven individuals , the Israeli military prepared two Lockheed C - 130 Hercules transports for the raid .	The transports refuelled in Kenya before landing at Entebbe Airport under the cover of darkness .	The commandos led by Brigadier General Dan Shomron ( Harris Yulin ) had to contend with a large armed Ugandan military detachment and used a ruse to overcome the defenses .	A black Mercedes limousine had been carried on board and was used to fool sentries that it was the official car which President Amin used on an impromptu visit to the airport .	Nearly complete surprise was achieved but a firefight resulted , ending with all seven terrorists and 45 Ugandan soldiers killed .
