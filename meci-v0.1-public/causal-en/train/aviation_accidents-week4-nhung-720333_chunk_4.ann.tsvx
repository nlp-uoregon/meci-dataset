Text	Despite this , the captain was able to fight the lack of gravity and re-enter the cockpit .	The speed of the 767 was now dangerously close to the sound barrier , exceeding its design limits and beginning to weaken its airframe .	The captain pulled back on his control column and applied full power to the engines , but neither action had any effect due to the aircraft 's speed and the engines having been shut down .	The captain then deployed the speedbrakes , which slowed the aircraft 's dive , bringing it back to a safer speed .	However , these abrupt maneuvers resulted in the aircraft entering a steep climb , causing g - forces to push the passengers and crew into their seats .
