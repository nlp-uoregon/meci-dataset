Text	By this time , his personal Sopwith Camel ( serial no. B6313 ) had become the most successful fighter aircraft in the history of the RAF , Barker having used it to shoot down 46 aircraft and balloons from September 1917 to September 1918 , for a total of 404 operational flying hours .	It was dismantled in October 1918 , Barker keeping the clock as a memento , although he was asked to return it the following day .	During this time , Barker trialed a series of modifications to B 6313 , to improve its combat performance .	The Clerget rotary engine 's cooling efficiency was poorer in the hotter Italian climate , so several supplementary cooling slots were cut into the cowling .	The poor upward visibility of the Camel resulted in Barker cutting away progressively larger portions of the center - section fabric .
