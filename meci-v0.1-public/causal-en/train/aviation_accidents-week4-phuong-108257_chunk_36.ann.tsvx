Text	At 18:27:20 , ICAO graphing of Digital Flight Data Recorder tapes showed that after a descent phase and a 10 second " nose - up " , KAL 007 was leveled out at pre-missile detonation altitude of , forward acceleration was back to pre-missile detonation rate of zero acceleration , and air speed had returned to pre-detonation velocity .	Yaw ( oscillations ) , begun at the time of missile detonation , continued decreasingly until the end of the 1 minute 44 second section of the tape .	The Boeing did not break up , explode or plummet immediately after the attack ; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes , then leveled off at ( 18:30 â€“ 18:31 UTC ) , rather than continuing to descend to as previously reported to Tokyo Area Control Center .	It continued at this altitude for almost five more minutes ( 18:35 UTC ) .	The last cockpit voice recorder entry occurred at 18:27:46 while in this phase of the descent .
