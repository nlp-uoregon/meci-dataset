Text	On 17 January 1978 , a Green Jackets observation post deployed around the village of Jonesborough began to take heavy fire from the " March Wall " , which drew parallel with the Irish border to the east , along the Dromad woods .	The soldiers returned fire , but the short distance to the border and the open ground prevented them from advancing .	The Commanding Officer , Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden - Lloyd , along with Captain Schofield and Sergeant Ives flew from the battalion base at Bessbrook Mill to assess the situation and provide information to the troops .	They were escorted by a Scout helicopter with an Airborne Reaction Force ( ARF ) , comprising a medic and three soldiers from the 2nd Bn Light Infantry .	While hovering over the scene of the engagement , the Gazelle received a barrage of 7.62 mm tracer rounds .
