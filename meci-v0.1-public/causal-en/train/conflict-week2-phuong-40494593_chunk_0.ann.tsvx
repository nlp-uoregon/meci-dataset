Text	The SPARTACIST UPRISING ( ) , also known as the JANUARY UPRISING (_ Januar aufstand _ ) , was a general strike ( and the armed battles accompanying it ) in Berlin from 5 to 12 January 1919 .	Germany was in the middle of a post-war revolution , and two of the perceived paths forward were social democracy and a council republic similar to the one which had been established by the Bolsheviks in Russia .	The uprising was primarily a power struggle between the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) led by Friedrich Ebert and the Communist Party of Germany ( KPD ) , led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg , who had previously founded and led the Spartacist League (_ Spartakusbund _ ) .	The revolt was improvised and small - scale and was quickly crushed by the superior firepower of government troops , but Berlin was largely undisturbed .	Long - distance trains continued to run on time and newspapers remained on sale , as the rebels passively confined themselves to only a few select locations .
