Text	Scarfe wrote in 1947 that , had the operation gone more smoothly , further elements of the division and elements of the 3rd Canadian Division would have launched Operation Aberlour , an ambitious plan to capture several villages north of Caen but the attack was cancelled by Lieutenant - General John Crocker .	Several days later I Corps launched a new offensive , codenamed Operation Charnwood , to gain possession of Caen .	In a frontal assault , the northern half of the city was captured , but German forces retained possession of the city south of the River Orne .	The southern half of Caen was only captured 12 days later by Canadian infantry during Operation Atlantic .	-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-___-
