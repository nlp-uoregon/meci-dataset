Text	It was gradually becoming apparent that the British would not be able to make the hook - up with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division necessary to protect its right flank in an immediate assault on Caen .	Troops of the King 's Shropshire Light Infantry continued down the Hermanville - Caen road , reaching Bi√©ville - Beuville , close to Caen , but were supported by only a few self - propelled guns , their flanks exposed .	The issue was fully rendered moot when , on the afternoon of 6 June , the 21st Panzer Division , based around Caen , launched the only major German counterattack of D - Day .	The 21st Panzer Division , with its formidable inventory of some 127 Panzer IV tanks , was intended for use as a rapid response force ; on the morning of 6 June , however , its commander , _ Generalmajor _ Edgar Feuchtinger , was in Paris , and Rommel was in Germany .	The division was unable to finalize orders and preparations for a counterattack until late in the day .
