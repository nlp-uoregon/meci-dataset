Text	Following the Yamasee War , these Tuscarora were asked by South Carolina officials to remain in South Carolina as their allies and to protect the colony from Spain and its Native American allies .	As part of the arrangement , South Carolina would return to the Tuscarora one slave taken during the Tuscarora War for each Tuscarora killed in the line of duty and for each enemy Native American they captured .	During this time , the Tuscarora came to be so well respected by the South Carolina government that they were given land in the colony .	The Yamasee War and other conflicts between the remaining Tuscarora and other Native American groups in the region are examples of how the Tuscarora War destabilized relationships among southern Native Americans .	The Tuscarora War and the Yamasee War were turning points in the Carolinas ' slave trade .
