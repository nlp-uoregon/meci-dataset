Text	Some coastal and river areas have retained and regularly test the sirens as part of the flood warning defences .	Since 1952 , Broadmoor Hospital has employed a network of 14 sirens to warn of escaped patients ; this is tested every Monday at 10 am .	The hospital sirens were scheduled for removal during 2018 except for one located in the hospital grounds .	Carstairs Hospital also retains its sirens , which are tested monthly .	In some towns , sirens were once used to summon part - time firemen until the introduction of radio pagers during the 1970s â€“ these ' stand alone ' sirens operated independently of the warning network .
