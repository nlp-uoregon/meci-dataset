Text	On March 8 , 1949 , the US Armed Forces sent an investigation team headed by Colonel James A. Casteel to Jeju to investigate the causes of the rebellion .	They summarized that the February 1948 Jeju general strike prior to the rebellion was caused by instigation by the South Korean Labor Party and hostility towards the police as a result of shootings .	They also described the strike as " communist inspired " but participated by both the left and right in response to the March 1 shootings .	By the spring of 1949 four South Korean Army battalions arrived and joined the local constabulary , police forces , and right - wing Northwest Youth Association partisans to brutally suppress protests .	The combined forces quickly destroyed or disabled most of the remaining rebel forces .
