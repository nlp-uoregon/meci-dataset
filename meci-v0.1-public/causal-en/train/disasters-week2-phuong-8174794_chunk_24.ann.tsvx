Text	Firefighters across North America protested that it was insensitive to make a film about fallen firefighters while their children were still young , and Worcester Fire Fighters IAFF Local 1009 wrote to other firefighters asking them not to participate in the movie 's production .	This resulted in the production company being unable to procure agreements in the United States or Canada to allow the use of firefighter insignia , while Canadian firefighters refused to act as extras and fire departments in the Toronto metropolitan area refused to lease firetrucks to the company .	In late April 2004 , Warner Bros. and Image Entertainment , the production company , issued a joint statement saying that the making of a film the size and scope of _ Worcester Cold Storage _ was " a complex process that needed the support of various groups and individuals , including firefighters .	Due to circumstances beyond our control , we no longer have such support .	We have therefore decided not to move ahead with this project at this time . "
