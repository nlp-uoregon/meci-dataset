Text	The ensuing Ponting / Brian Lara partnership saw both players reach half - centuries , with Lara 's 50 coming in 76 balls , a relatively slow speed compared with the power - hitting to be seen later .	Lara was dismissed for 52 , due to a well - taken Chaminda Vaas catch in the deep off Anil Kumble .	Ponting , who was closing in on his century , was then forced to play second - fiddle to a whirlwind innings by New Zealand all - rounder Chris Cairns , who at one point had contributed more than 40 runs off a 60 run partnership .	Kumble bore the brunt of this attack , with several balls disappearing into the crowd for 6 .	Cairns also contributed the shot of the match , a straight - driven 6 off Muttiah Muralitharan from halfway down the pitch .
