Text	A tent city of at least 17 tents and 30 occupants was set up at Centennial Square , with plans to remain until the social and economic problems that prompted the Occupy movement are addressed .	Victoria Mayor Dean Fortin initial praised the PAOV movement and its international counterparts as "_ citizen participation and one of the emerging issues of our times _, " saying that "_ people have an urgent need to be involved in the events and process that shape their lives . _"	Fortin later retracted his support for the protesters stating ( referring to the PAOV and their tent city in Centennial Square ) _ " I think we 're coming to a place where more and more , much like Vancouver , we 're getting concerned about the safety issues " ._	On November 5 , 2011 , demonstrators held a flash occupation at the intersection of Fort Street and Douglas Street , the centre of Victoria 's financial district , to commemorate Bank Transfer Day .	The two banks at this intersection ( RBC and TD Canada Trust ) temporarily shut down and locked their doors " due to protesting " .
