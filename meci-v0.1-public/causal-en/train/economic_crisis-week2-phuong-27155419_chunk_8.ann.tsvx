Two days later , Underhill apparently acted alone in a bank robbery in Canton , Kansas but rejoined the gang by the time the Bailey - Underhill Gang struck a bank in Kingfisher , Oklahoma on August 9 , 1933 .	Three days after the Kingfisher robbery , Bailey was visiting Robert Shannon , father - in - law of Machine Gun Kelly , at his Texas ranch and safehouse when police and federal agents raided the property .	Bailey had been passed ransom money from Kelly 's kidnapping of oil tycoon Charles Urschel and wrongly convicted in the plot two months later .	With Bailey serving a life sentence , Underhill took charge of the gang .
