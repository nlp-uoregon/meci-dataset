Text	If borrowers default at first period , upon observing this default , lenders will make an inference about the likely realization of the magnitude of borrowers ’ first period shocks indirectly and update their expectations to be pessimistic on borrowers ’ future output and their repayment prospects on future loans .	Although borrowers can get fresh lending again , they need to pay higher interest rates than the case they did not default in the past .	The gap between the interest rates for fresh lending with and without past default is defined as default premium , which can also be seen as the difference between the new debt issue prices with and without past default .	Therefore , if borrowers default , they will face a positive default premium , namely higher interest rates and lower new debt issuing price .	If the investment requirement is relatively inelastic , in another word , the amount of investment requirement relatively not affected by debt issuing price , borrowers have to issue more debts to compensate for low issue prices to acquire the required amount of investment .
