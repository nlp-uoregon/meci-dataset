Text	These institutions as well as certain regulated banks had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses .	The losses experienced by financial institutions on their mortgage - related securities impacted their ability to lend , slowing economic activity .	Interbank lending dried - up initially and then loans to non-financial firms were affected .	Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to take action to provide funds to encourage lending and to restore faith in the commercial paper markets , which are integral to funding business operations .	Governments also bailed out key financial institutions , assuming significant additional financial commitments .
