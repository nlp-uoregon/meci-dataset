Text	For a summary of U.S. government financial commitments and investments related to the crisis , see CNN â€“ Bailout Scorecard .	[ People queuing outside a Northern Rock bank branch in Birmingham , United Kingdom , on September 15 , 2007 , to withdraw their savings because of the subprime crisis . ]	Several major financial institutions either failed , were bailed out by governments , or merged ( voluntarily or otherwise ) during the crisis .	While the specific circumstances varied , in general the decline in the value of mortgage - backed securities held by these companies resulted in either their insolvency , the equivalent of bank runs as investors pulled funds from them , or inability to secure new funding in the credit markets .	These firms had typically borrowed and invested large sums of money relative to their cash or equity capital , meaning they were highly leveraged and vulnerable to unanticipated credit market disruptions .
