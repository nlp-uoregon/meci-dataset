Text	The Dodd - Frank Act addressed these elements , but stopped short of breaking up the largest banks , which grew larger due to mergers of investment banks at the core of the crisis with depository banks ( e.g. , JP Morgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns and Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch in 2008 ) .	Assets of five largest banks as a share of total commercial banking assets rose then stabilized in the wake of the crisis .	During 2013 , Senators John McCain ( Republican ) and Elizabeth Warren ( Democratic ) proposed a bill to separate investment and depository banking , to insulate depository banks from higher risk activities .	These were separated prior to the 1999 repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act .	Significant law enforcement action and litigation resulted from the crisis .
