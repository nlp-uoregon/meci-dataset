Text	When the epidemic broke out from the _ Emily B. Souder _ in May , roughly 40,000 residents that represent 20 % of the city population fled the city , many of whom fled via the new railroads systems constructed during the Reconstruction period after the American Civil War , which further spread the virus across the Lower Mississippi Valley .	The city saw roughly 20,000 total infections during the epidemic with 5,000 resulting in deaths , and saw a loss of more than $ 15 million due to the disruptions in trade from the epidemic .	Due to the struggles of the remaining citizens , numerous organizations formed relief committees that relied heavily on aid from the federal government in the form of relief rations and money donations from unaffected cities in the Northern United States .	The federal relief came with heavy restrictions , as they were only allowed to be given to households that had yellow fever and could provide proof via a doctor 's certificate or given to people considered " destitute . "	These restrictions led to many citizens having to go without federal aid , resulting in roughly 10,000 people receiving aid despite there being 20,000 cases of yellow fever alone .
