Text	Even when school closures are temporary , it carries high social and economic costs .	However , the significance of children in spreading COVID - 19 is unclear .	While the full impact of school closures during the coronavirus pandemic are not yet known , UNESCO advises that school closures have negative impacts on local economies and on learning outcomes for students .	In early March 2020 , the sentiment " Stay The Fuck Home " was coined by Florian Reifschneider , a German engineer and was quickly echoed by notable celebrities such as Taylor Swift , Ariana Grande and Busy Philipps in hopes of reducing and delaying the peak of the outbreak .	Facebook , Twitter and Instagram also joined the campaign with similar hashtags , stickers and filters under # staythefhome , # stayhome , # staythefuckhome and began trending across social media .
