Text	FluMist was initially priced higher than the injectable vaccines , but sold only 500,000 of the four million doses it produced its first year on the market , despite a comparative shortage of flu vaccine in fall 2004 .	The price was sharply lowered the next year , and the company reported distributing 1.6 million doses in 2005 .	Because of the price drop , despite selling almost three times as many doses in 2005 , the company reported $ 21 million in FluMist sales , compared to $ 48 million the previous year .	Further cuts in pricing had to await FDA approval of a refrigerator - cooled FluMist formulation , as the initial formulation required freezer storage and thawing on demand before administration .	Although it is positioned as a premium product , the remaining price premium for FluMist over the cost of needle - injected vaccine is small .
