Text	The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms , where farmers are in close contact with live pigs .	Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans , it may occasionally happen , so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals .	The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine - to - human transmission .	Risk factors that may contribute to the swine - to - human transmission include smoking and , especially , not wearing gloves when working with sick animals , thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand - to - eye , hand - to - nose , or hand - to - mouth transmission .	Influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze , then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face . " Avoid touching your eyes , nose or mouth .
