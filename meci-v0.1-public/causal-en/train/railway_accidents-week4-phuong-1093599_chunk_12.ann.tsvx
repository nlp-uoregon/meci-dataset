Text	A special case is heat related BUCKLING : in hot weather the rail steel expands .	This is managed by stressing continuously welded rails ( they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature ) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated .	In addition , lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder .	If any of these measures are inadequate , the track may buckle ; a large lateral distortion takes place , which trains are unable to negotiate .	( In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/ 9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain ) .
