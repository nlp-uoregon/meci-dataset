Text	- A RUNAWAY SPAR ( formerly _ Category D SPAD_ ) is where an unattended train or vehicles not attached to a traction unit run away past a signal at danger .	Note that where this was the fault of the driver , this will be classed as a SPAD .	SPADs arising on starting from stations - typically those informally termed ' ding - ding right - aways ' , where the driver has inadvertently acted on a guard or dispatcher 's indication without reading the signal - can be classified further :	- SAS SPAD – " Starting against signal " SPAD , where the train was standing at a danger signal and the driver moved past it .	- SOY SPAD – " Starting on yellow " SPAD , where the train left on a caution signal and the driver did not appreciate that the next signal might be at danger .
