Text	جب برطانوی افسروں نے چرچل کی توجہ بنگال میں بڑے پیمانے پر ہونے والی اموات کی طرف دلائی تو چرچل کا جواب تھا کہ " پھر گاندھی ابھی تک کیوں نہیں مرا ؟	"	“ And when conscience -stricken British officials wrote to the Prime Minister in London pointing out that his policies were causing needless loss of life all he could do was write peevishly in the margin of the report , ‘ Why hasn’t Gandhi died yet ?' "	-	1943 - 1944 ء کے بنگال کے قحط کی وجہ خراب فصل نہیں تھی ۔
